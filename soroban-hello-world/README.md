## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a transparent, trustless ecosystem for asset leasing that eliminates intermediaries and reduces friction in the leasing process. By tokenizing leasing agreements on the Stellar blockchain, we aim to:

1. Create a global marketplace for asset leasing
2. Reduce costs associated with traditional leasing models
3. Increase accessibility to valuable assets through fractional leasing
4. Establish immutable records of asset ownership and leasing history
5. Enable automated enforcement of lease terms through smart contracts
6. Provide liquidity for asset owners while maintaining ownership
